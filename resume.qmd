I'm a **Data Analyst III at GitHub** in San Francisco, California ðŸŒ‰

---

### Key Skills
- Led data modeling efforts to create more efficient and approable ETL data tables using Airflow for stakeholders.  

-	Completed PhD degree in quantitative discipline with focus on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data through machine learning models. Over 12 years programming in python, R, and SQL.  

-	Analyzed large datasets (linear models, multivariate models, random forest, and time series analysis) and coded full-stack data science experiments in python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, R).

-	Communicated with 6 cross-functional business and government teams and led efforts to define new data collection and analytical processes. Increased data repeatability and metric scalability by 5% each month.

-	Worked with business and industry leaders to establish business needs. Translated questions valued at US$ 90 billion dollars into data science experiments. Identified practices that improve yields by 10%.

-	Wrote 40 technical documents including scientific papers, government white papers, and executive summaries of research from 20 statistically rigorous machine learning experiments.

:::
*GitHub*

- Created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) and propose new data modeling to enable novel insight and help the company drive toward SLOs. 
- Achieved stakeholder consensus on  ADR, and am currently building an ETL data pipeline using airflow to execute on the ADR.
- I co-authored an analytics report on 2-factor authentication to create a more seamless sign-up and onboarding experience for our users. I used SQL and python to query data, create figures and produce statistics.
